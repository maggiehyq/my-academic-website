abstract: The seller's price concession reflects the existence of asymmetric information in the second-hand housing market, and it is beneficial to study the influence of the brokerâ€™s commission incentive source on the information transmission in the process of second-hand housing transactions. This study examined 310,332 transactions in 17 cities, using the spatio-temporal autoregressive model. Results mainly revealed price concession under the both sides broker commission arrangement was 1.64% significantly lower than that under the buyer-side commission. The broker commission incentive has a moderating effect on the transmission of market information during transactions, whereas the both-sides commission leads to an increase in the effect of objective market conditions and reduces the difference of effects of individual factors on price concessions. An exogenous demand shock may lead to a change in the relationship between brokers' actions and sellers' pricing strategies. The implications will serve to improve the norms of and transparency in the second-hand housing transaction market, and resolve the disparity between the broker agent mode and commission incentive scheme.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: The decisions a researcher makes at the model building stage are crucial for parameter identification. This paper contains a number of applied tips for solving identifiability problems and improving the strength of DSGE model parameter identification by fine-tuning the (1) choice of observables, (2) functional specifications, (3) model features and (4) choice of structural shocks. We offer a formal approach based on well-established diagnostics and indicators to uncover and address both theoretical (yes/no) identifiability issues and weak identification from a Bayesian perspective. The concepts are illustrated by two exemplary models that demonstrate the identification properties of different investment adjustment cost specifications and output-gap definitions. Our results provide theoretical support for the use of growth adjustment costs, investment-specific technology, and partial inflation indexation.
