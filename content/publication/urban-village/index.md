abstract: With rapid urbanization taking place in China in recent decades, urban village redevelopment is increasingly recognized as a viable strategy to promote efficient land use and urban revitalization, which entails externalities at the local level. This paper examines the external effects of urban village redevelopment on the local housing market over three project phases, i.e. before, during and after redevelopment. We apply a staggered difference-in-differences model to the housing transaction data of Zhengzhou city, and our results reveal the presence of a positive spillover from urban village redevelopment to the local housing market. Specifically, during the project development phase, urban village redevelopment brings about a housing price premium of 4.9% within the treatment area. After project completion, redevelopment further contributes 4.9% to the local house price premium. These results are robust to heterogeneity in terms of the redevelopment project scale as well as the economic well-being of the districts where the urban villages are located.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: Closed-form expressions for unconditional moments, cumulants and polyspectra of order higher than two are derived for non-Gaussian or nonlinear (pruned) solutions to DSGE models. Apart from the existence of moments and white noise property no distributional assumptions are needed. The accuracy and utility of the formulas for computing skewness and kurtosis are demonstrated by three prominent models, the baseline medium-sized New Keynesian model used for empirical analysis (first-order approximation), a small-scale monetary business cycle model (second-order approximation) and the neoclassical growth model (third-order approximation). Both the Gaussian as well as Student's t-distribution are considered as the underlying stochastic processes. Lastly, the efficiency gain of including higher-order statistics is demonstrated by the estimation of a RBC model within a Generalized Method of Moments framework.
