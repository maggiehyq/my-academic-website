abstract: The urban resale housing market has seen an increasing influence from the judicial auction housing segment. This study delves into judicial auction housing discounts and the underpinning mechanisms from the standpoint of buyer risk preference and market interplay. Transaction data from 11 prominent cities in China, spanning July 2017 to October 2020, were analyzed. Principal empirical outcomes suggest an average economic depreciation for China's judicial auction housing market of approximately 14%, corroborated by our neighbor-matched sample. Key findings suggest a substitution effect between the judicial auction and regular resale segments and highlight the significance of purchasing risk as a determinant for this channel. Moreover, an increase in uncertainty about the overall market environment could intensify demand flowing out of the judicial auction market as well as its economic depreciation. The results offer insightful implications for policy designers, emphasizing the enhancement of judicial auction housing quality and the need for improving transparency of information in the resale housing market.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: Closed-form expressions for unconditional moments, cumulants and polyspectra of order higher than two are derived for non-Gaussian or nonlinear (pruned) solutions to DSGE models. Apart from the existence of moments and white noise property no distributional assumptions are needed. The accuracy and utility of the formulas for computing skewness and kurtosis are demonstrated by three prominent models, the baseline medium-sized New Keynesian model used for empirical analysis (first-order approximation), a small-scale monetary business cycle model (second-order approximation) and the neoclassical growth model (third-order approximation). Both the Gaussian as well as Student's t-distribution are considered as the underlying stochastic processes. Lastly, the efficiency gain of including higher-order statistics is demonstrated by the estimation of a RBC model within a Generalized Method of Moments framework.
